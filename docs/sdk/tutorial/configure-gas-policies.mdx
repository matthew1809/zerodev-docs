# Configure Gas Policies

By default, your users pay for their own gas, but you can choose to sponsor some (or all) transactions for your users, particularly those that are critical for onboarding.  To set up which transactions you would like to sponsor, you configure the *gas policies* associated with your project.

Go to the `Gas Policies` section of your dashboard.

## Create a known contract

Since it's unsafe to sponsor *all* transactions for a user (in which case they might drain your funds by spamming useless transactions), you need to tell ZeroDev about the contracts that you do wish to sponsor transactions for.

Create a new known contract by clicking the "New" button in the "Known Contracts" section, then enter:

- The name of the contract (it can be any name you want; the name is only for identification purposes)
- The address of the contract (in this case it's `0xedC43EBe3CF104b5e8fCa2A25950a7c28656e285`).
- The ABI of the contract.

There are many ways to obtain the ABI of a contract.  If you are unsure how to obtain the ABI of *your* contracts, ask your developers.  For this tutorial, use the following ABI:

```
[{
      "inputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "uint256",
          "name": "amount",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ],
      "name": "claim",
      "outputs": [],
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "function"
}]
```

Your input should look something like this:

  <img src="/img/new_known_contract.png" width="60%" />
</p>


Now click `Create Contract`.

## Create a new policy

You configure which transactions to sponsor by setting up *policies*.

Click `New` in the "Policies" section and set up the following parameters.

### Strategy

Broadly speaking, there are two types of strategies:

- Pay gas for users.  Here you pay gas for your users either fully or partially.

- Charge gas in custom tokens.  Here your users pay gas, but instead of paying in ETH (or whatever the native gas token is), they pay in a custom ERC20 token, such as the token from your application/protocol.

For this tutorial, choose the `Pay gas for users` strategy from the dropdown.

### Transactions

Now is the time to specify the transactions for whom you'd like to sponsor gas.

Click `+` under `Allowed Transactions`.  In this case, we want to sponsor the `claim` transactions so users can claim tokens without paying gas.

### Rate Limits

To prevent malicious users from abusing the system, it's important to set up rate limits to limit the amount of transactions you sponsor.  To create a new rate limit, click `+` under `Rate Limits`.  You can set up as many rate limits as you want.

At this point, your input should look something like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/new_policy.png" width="60%" />
</p>

Click `Create Policy`.
