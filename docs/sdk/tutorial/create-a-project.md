# Create a Project

## Sign up for the dashboard

If you haven't already, head to [the ZeroDev dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app) and sign up.

## Create a new project

Once inside the dashboard, click `Create project` and input a name for your project and the blockchain network you are targetting.  For the tutorial, select the "Polygon Mumbai" network.

Once a project has been created, you will see the project ID.  We will use this ID when we set up the SDK.
