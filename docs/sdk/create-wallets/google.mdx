# Google (Deprecated)

*Creating an AA signer from a Google login is deprecated.  This feature may stop working at any time.  If you need social signins, consider using [ZeroKit](/zerokit/getting-started) instead.*

ZeroDev can easily integrate with Google signin.  There are many solutions for integrating with Google sigin, such as [the official guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/overview).  If you are using React, we also recommend [this library](https://github.com/MomenSherif/react-oauth).

For now, we will simply assume that your users can sign into your app with Google, and now you want to give each of your user a Web3 wallet, such that they can easily use your Web3 features.

## Get a wallet with Google access token

Not matter how you implemented Google signin, you should end up with an "[ID Token](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/backend-auth)" which is an encoded JWT token.  ZeroDev will take this token and turn it into a Web3 wallet that only your user has access to:

```javascript
import * as zd from '@zerodevapp/sdk'

const wallet = await zd.getSigner({
  projectId: "insert your project ID",
  identity: "google",
  token: idToken, // this is the Google ID token
})
```

Just like that, your user now has a wallet!  The `wallet` object that ZeroDev returns is a [`Signer`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer) that is widely compatible with popular Web3 libraries such as Ethers.js.  You can now use this object to transfer balance, interact with smart contracts, sign messages, and more.  To learn more, check out [Ethers's documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/).
