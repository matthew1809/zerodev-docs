# Privy (beta)

[Privy](https://www.privy.io/) is Web3 onboarding solution that includes an embedded wallet for users who don't have a wallet.  You can use ZeroDev with Privy to offer smart wallets for those users instead of EOA wallets.

Privy integration is currently in beta.  Please contact hello@zerodev.app or [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/KS9MRaTSjx) to get access to the beta.
