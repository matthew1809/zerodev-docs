# Dynamic

[Dynamic](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/embedded-wallets/add-account-abstraction) is a platform that offers Web3 login solutions designed for easy integration and user-friendly experiences.  It features passkey embedded wallets, crypto-native login, and profile and multi-wallet management. Additionally, the platform provides tools for authorization, orchestration, and more, aiming to streamline wallet-based authentication and identity management.  Dynamic is built to cater to both casual users and crypto-savvy individuals, emphasizing non-custodial, passwordless, and flexible login options.

Dynamic has built a first-class integration with ZeroDev.  The Dynamic dashboard and wallet UI know to display the correct SCW address, and the transaction UI is dynamically adjusted based on gas sponsorship.
