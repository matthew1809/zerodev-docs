# Getting Started

ZeroKit is a turn-key AA wallet widget that can be embedded inside your app with just 5 lines of code.  Once embedded, your users can sign in with social account and Web3 wallets, and then interact with your app through an AA wallet, enabling all kinds of [powerful features](/use-wallets/overview).

Here's a demo of an NFT drop using ZeroKit:

import SponsoredMintExample from '@site/src/components/SponsoredMintExample';

<SponsoredMintExample label="Try ZeroKit" />

### Step 1: Sign up

Sign up at [the ZeroDev dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app) and create a new project.  You will need the project ID to set up ZeroKit.

### Step 2: Installation
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <pre>
        <codeblock>npm install --save zerokit</codeblock>
    </pre>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <pre>
        <codeblock>yarn add zerokit</codeblock>
    </pre>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Setup ZeroKit

ZeroKit is built on top of [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction) and [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), so the dev experience is almost the same.  [See here](/create-wallets/zerokit/rainbow-kit) for converting a RainbowKit app to a ZeroKit app.

You will need your `projectId` here to setup the SDK.

```jsx
import 'zerokit/styles.css';
import { ZeroKitProvider } from "zerokit";
```
```jsx
// Wrap your component with ZeroKitProvider, which is the equivalent
// of a WagmiConfig.
<ZeroKitProvider projectId="<your-project-id>">
    <YourApp />
</ZeroKitProvider>
```

If you are running build into issues with Webpack, [take a look here](/create-wallets/zerokit/common-issues).

### Step 4: Connect

In `YourApp`, use the `ConnectButton` component to create a connect button, and use Wagmi to interact with the user's wallet.

```jsx
import { ConnectButton } from "zerokit";
```
```jsx live
<ConnectButton label="Social Wallet" />
```

### Step 5: Build

From here on, you would build your app the same way you build any [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) apps.

Keep in mind that the *signer* you obtain from Wagmi (e.g. through [`useSigner`](https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useSigner)) is backed by an account abstraction wallet.  As a result, it can be used with the [ZeroKit SDK](/use-wallets/overview) to enable powerful AA features.


```jsx
import { useSigner } from "wagmi";
import * as zd from '@zerodevapp/sdk';

function MyComponent() {
  const { data: signer } = useSigner()


  const handleClick = async () => {
    zd.execBatch(signer, [ transaction1, transaction2 ])
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={handleClick}>
      Batch Mint
    </Button>
  )
}
```

[See here](/use-wallets/overview) for examples of AA features.

### Step 6: Deployment - Whitelisting your domain
Using ZeroKit locally will work just fine, but when deployed to the WWW you will have to whitelist your domain so your hosted client is able to pass authentication.
You can do so via the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/), the same place where your `projectId` resides.

Let's follow by an example. We deployed our ZeroKit demo to `https://demo.zerodev.app`, therefore we need to whitelist the domain.

1. We go to the Dashboard and select the project we are using. Then we should see the following box:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/whitelisting_domain.png" width="50%" />
</p>
2. We add our domain to the input field and save. The end result should be:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/whitelisted_domain.png" width="50%" />
</p>

That's it.
