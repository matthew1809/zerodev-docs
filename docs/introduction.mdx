# Introduction

ZeroKit is a groundbreaking solution for onboarding users to Web3 and building powerful Web3 experiences.

ZeroKit is built on top of [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), the first practical implementation of account abstraction (AA) on EVM blockchains.

## Onboard users to Web3

Like existing Web3 onboarding solutions such as Magic or Web3Auth, ZeroKit creates wallets for your users that support:
- Social logins
- Fiat onramp
- Embedded wallet widgets
- WalletConnect
- And more.

## Build powerful Web3 experiences

But what makes ZeroKit unique is that it creates *smart contract wallets* powered by account abstraction.  As a result, you can build Web3 experiences that are hitherto impossible:

- Sponsor gas for your users.
- Let your users pay gas in ERC20 tokens, such as your own DApp tokens or stablecoins.
- Bundle transactions to vastly speed up (and lower the cost of) complex blockchain interactions, such as depositing liquidity into DeFi protocols.
- Skip confirmations altogether with session keys -- temporary keys bound by  security policies.
- Impose transaction checks before and after a transaction, e.g. to enforce spending limits.
- Flexible account recovery, such as social recovery.
- NFT subscriptions.
- And so much more!

Did we mention that, despite all these great benefits, ZeroKit wallets are still fully non-custodial?

With ZeroKit, you can unlock the power of account abstraction with just 5 lines of code!  Here's an example:
