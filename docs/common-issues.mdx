# Common Issues

## Polyfill issues

If you are running errors like `Uncaught Reference Error: process is not defined`, it's likely that you are running into polyfill issues.  [Please check here](https://web3auth.io/docs/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) for how to fix it.

## NextJS

If you are using NextJS with our social wallets, you may need to set up transpiling.

For NextJS running on a version <=13.1.x, you need to use [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules).

```
// next.config.js

const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['@zerodevapp', '@web3']); // pass the modules you would like to see transpiled

module.exports = withTM({});
```

For NextJS running on a version >= 13.2.x, you can utilize the built-in `transpilePackages` config option.

```
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ["@zerodevapp", "@web3"],
};
```

Here's an [example project](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-nextjs-example) of ZeroDev + NextJS.

## Cloudflare Workers
Using ZeroDev with Cloudflare Workers requires setting the `skipFetchSetup` option to `true`.
```typescript
const smartContractWallet = await getZeroDevSigner({
  projectId,
  owner,
  skipFetchSetup: true
})
```

## WalletConnect Issues

If you are having issues connecting a ZeroDev wallet through WalletConnect, refer to [this working example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-walletconnect-example).

## Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE) issues

If you are having issues using SIWE with a ZeroDev wallet, refer to [this working example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/nextjs-siwe).

Note that an undeployed ZeroDev wallet cannot sign into SIWE until it supports [ERC-6492](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492).  This is an [ongoing effort](https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/153).  Long story short, currently you need to make sure that your ZeroDev wallet is actually deployed (meaning that it must have sent at least one transaction) before SIWE can work.
