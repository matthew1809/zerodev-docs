# Common Issues

## Polyfill issues

If you are running errors like `Uncaught Reference Error: process is not defined`, it's likely that you are running into polyfill issues.  [Please check here](https://web3auth.io/docs/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) for how to fix it.

## NextJS

(Example Project)[https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-nextjs-example]

Web3Auth and our builds require to be transpiled because they are ES Modules and not CommonJS Modules.

For NextJS running on a version <=13.1.x, you need to use [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules).
```
// next.config.js

const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['@zerodevapp', '@web3']); // pass the modules you would like to see transpiled

module.exports = withTM({});
```

For NextJS running on a version >= 13.2.x, you can utilize the build-in transpile package config.
```
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ["@zerodevapp", "@web3"],
};
```
