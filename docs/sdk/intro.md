# Introduction

ZeroDev is an SDK for creating powerful and easy-to-use Web3 applications using account abstraction (AA).

With ZeroDev, your users can interact with Web3 through an AA wallet, which can be thought of as a non-custodial wallet that is as easy as custodial wallets.

If you are not sure what AA can do, we recommend that you take a look at [our AA examples](/category/account-abstraction).

When you are ready to get started, take a look at [our tutorial](/sdk/tutorial/introduction).

If you are looking for a turn-key AA wallet with UI, check out [ZeroKit](/zerokit/getting-started).
