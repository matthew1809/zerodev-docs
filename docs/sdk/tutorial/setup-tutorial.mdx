# Setup Tutorial

Clone [the tutorial repo](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-tutorial):

```
git clone https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-tutorial
```

Change into the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:

```
cd zerodev-tutorial/frontend
npm install
```

Launch the frontend on localhost:

```
npm start
```

At this point, you should have a simple DApp running on http://localhost:3000.  Note that this tutorial runs on Polygon Mumbai (Polygon's testnet), so your wallet may prompt you to switch networks:

</p>

Once you switch network and connect your wallet, you should see something like this:

</p>

Let's claim some tokens!  Click the claim button.

Unfortunately, unless you happen to own some MATIC on Mumbai (which is the equivalent of ETH for Ethereum), you won't be able to send the transaction.  If this was a real application, your user would have to spend money to buy some gas at this point.

To recap, before your user could use your DApp, they had to:

- Download and install MetaMask
- Switch network if the app is built on a non-ETH chain (e.g. Polygon)
- Get some ETH (or MATIC in this case) in order to pay gas

A regular Web2 user would mostly likely have given up at some point.  Wouldn't it be MUCH better if we can do without these extra steps, so your users can just focus on USING your app?

Read on to see how ZeroDev enables you to do just that.
