# Common Issues

## React - Webpack 5
There are some issues using webpack 5 as certain packages (ethers.js and web3.js) which we are using require dependencies in the browser environment which webpack 5 is not providing.
This can be overcome by reconfiguring webpack 5. [Here](https://web3auth.io/docs/troubleshooting/webpack-issues#react) is an guide how to do so when initiating an application via `create-react-app`.

## Next.js
You will have to add `zerokit` and `@web3` to be transpiled by your typescript compiler:

```next.config.js```
```diff
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
+  transpilePackages: ['zerokit', '@web3'],
}
```
