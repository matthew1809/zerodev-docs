# Common Issues

## Polyfill issues

If you are running errors like `Uncaught Reference Error: process is not defined`, it's likely that you are running into polyfill issues.  [Please check here](https://web3auth.io/docs/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) for how to fix it.

## NextJS

If you are using NextJS with our social wallets, you may need to set up transpiling.

For NextJS running on a version <=13.1.x, you need to use [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules).

```
// next.config.js

const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['@zerodevapp', '@web3']); // pass the modules you would like to see transpiled

module.exports = withTM({});
```

For NextJS running on a version >= 13.2.x, you can utilize the built-in `transpilePackages` config option.

```
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ["@zerodevapp", "@web3"],
};
```

Here's an [example project](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-nextjs-example) of ZeroDev + NextJS.
