# Deploy to Production

### Whitelisting your domain

Using ZeroKit locally will work just fine, but when deployed to the web you will have to whitelist your domain, so your hosted ZeroKit widget is able to pass origin checks.

To whitelist origins, go to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/) and go to your project.

Let's use an example. Say we deployed our ZeroKit app to `https://demo.zerodev.app`, so we need to whitelist the domain.

1. We go to the dashboard and select the project we are using. Then we should see the following:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/whitelisting_domain.png" width="50%" />
</p>

2. We add our domain to the input field and click save. The end result should be:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/whitelisted_domain.png" width="50%" />
</p>

That's it!  Now you can use ZeroKit in production.
