# Overview

With ZeroDev wallets, you can build powerful and easy-to-use Web3 applications that are only possible with account abstraction (AA).

Generally speaking, the benefits of AA can be divided into two categories:

- Validation: by abstracting how transactions are validated, you can:
  - [Pay gas for users](/use-wallets/pay-gas-for-users)
  - [Let users pay gas in ERC20 tokens](/use-wallets/pay-gas-in-erc20)
  - [Replace the owner (key) of the wallet](/use-wallets/replace-wallet-owner)
  - [Set pre-conditions for transactions](/use-wallets/set-transaction-guards)
  - [Create session keys with limited permissions](/use-wallets/use-session-keys)

- Execution: by abstracting how transactions are executed, you can:
  - [Batch multiple transactions into one](/use-wallets/batch-transactions)
  - [Send transactions for users (but only if they allowed you to)](/use-wallets/send-transactions-for-users)
  - [Delegate call to a smart contract](/use-wallets/delegate-call)
  - [Update your wallet's execution logic](/use-wallets/update-wallets)
  - [Easily integrate with DeFi protocols](/use-wallets/integrate-defi)
