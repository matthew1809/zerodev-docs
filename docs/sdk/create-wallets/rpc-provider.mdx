# RPC Provider

ZeroDev wallets are smart contract wallets.  A smart contract wallet needs one or more "owners" -- accounts that can sign transactions for the wallet.  By default, a ZeroDev wallet has a single owner.

When you create a ZeroDev wallet, you need to tell ZeroDev who its owner is going to be.  The most flexible way to do that is to provide a RPC provider (one example would be the `window.ethereum` object that MetaMask injects).

## Example: Magic

Say you want to use [Magic](https://magic.link/) to handle social logins, but you want to use ZeroDev to create AA wallets for your users.

Magic exposes an `rpcProvider`.  To create a ZeroDev wallet using Magic, simply pass the rpc provider to the SDK:

```javascript
import * as zd from '@zerodevapp/sdk'

const magic = new Magic('MAGIC_API_KEY', {
  // some magic options...
})

const wallet = await zd.getSigner({
  projectId: "insert your project ID",
  web3Provider: magic.rpcProvider,
})
```

Now your user has a ZeroDev wallet that supports AA features, such as gas-free transactions!  The `wallet` object that ZeroDev returns is a [`Signer`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer) that is widely compatible with popular Web3 libraries such as Ethers.js.  You can now use this object to transfer balance, interact with smart contracts, sign messages, and more.  To learn more, check out [Ethers's documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/).
