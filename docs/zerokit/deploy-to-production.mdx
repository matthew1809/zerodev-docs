# Deploy to Production

### Whitelisting your domain

Using ZeroKit locally will work just fine, but when deployed to the web you will have to whitelist your domain so your hosted client is able to pass authentication.

You can do so via the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/), the same place where your `projectId` resides.

Let's follow by an example. We deployed our ZeroKit demo to `https://demo.zerodev.app`, therefore we need to whitelist the domain.

1. We go to the Dashboard and select the project we are using. Then we should see the following box:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/whitelisting_domain.png" width="50%" />
</p>
2. We add our domain to the input field and save. The end result should be:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/whitelisted_domain.png" width="50%" />
</p>

That's it!
