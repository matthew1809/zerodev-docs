### Social Logins
Your users want to login with Google, not MetaMask.<br />
With ZeroKit, your users can log into your DApp with social accounts -- no download required.<br />
Thanks to MPC, your users’s wallets remain fully non-custodial.

### Gas-free Transactions
Don’t ask your users to buy ETH before using your app.<br />
Thanks to account abstraction (AA), you can sponsor gas for your users, or let them pay gas in ERC20 tokens.<br />

### Interop with DApps
Your user’s Web3 journey started at you app, but it shouldn’t end there.<br />
With WalletConnect, your users can seamlessly use their assets on third-party DApps such as OpenSea, Uniswap, etc.

### Fiat Onramp
Not sure which onramp to use? We’ve got you covered.<br />
Using a meta onramp, ZeroKit always gives your users the best price.
