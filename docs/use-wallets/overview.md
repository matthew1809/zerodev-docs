# Using Smart Wallets

With ZeroDev wallets, you can build powerful and easy-to-use Web3 applications that are only possible with account abstraction (AA).

For your convenience, we have divided our AA features into the following categories:

- Gas
  - [Pay gas for users](/use-wallets/pay-gas-for-users)
  - [Let users pay gas in ERC20 tokens](/use-wallets/pay-gas-with-erc20-tokens)

- Transactions
  - [Send transactions](/use-wallets/send-transactions)
  - [Send transactions in batches](/use-wallets/batch-transactions)
  - [Session keys](/use-wallets/use-session-keys)

- Auth
  - [Multisig](/use-wallets/multisig)
  - [Validate signatures](/use-wallets/validate-signatures)

- Manage Wallets
  - [Update wallet owner](/use-wallets/change-wallet-owner)
  - [Recover a wallet](/use-wallets/recovery)
