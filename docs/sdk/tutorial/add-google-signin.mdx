# Add Social Login

Right now, your DApp has a "Connect Wallet" button, which works for users who already have wallets installed.  But wouldn't it be nice if anyone can use your DApp without installing a wallet?  What if they can sign in with a social identity, e.g. Google?

## Set up Identity Settings

Go to the `Social Logins` section of your dashboard and click on the `Google` tab.  In production, you will want to set up your own Google OAuth Client ID as described [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid).  But for this tutorial, just use `225383676269-snak87ndq8a6clk2t7vjo9ti4pufmobh.apps.googleusercontent.com` as the client ID.  Click save.

## Add a Google signin button

There are many ways to add a Google signin button, so we will not go over them here.  For this tutorial, we have made things easy for you:

- Head to `frontend/src/components/DApp.js` and uncomment [line 78](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-tutorial/blob/aa5eae0a90b7a50fc39d5a13997fa3647abdcf10/frontend/src/components/Dapp.js#L78).
- Refresh `http://localhost:3000` to make sure that you see a Google signin button.

Try clicking the button and make sure that you see the Google signin flow.  Right now nothing happens after you sign in.  We will now tie the Google signin button to ZeroDev so that your user gets a wallet when they sign in.

## Connect Google signin to ZeroDev

When you sign in with Google on the frontend, a callback is executed with information from Google, including what is known as an "ID token" that uniquely identifies the user.  We will pass this token to the ZeroDev SDK, so it generates a unique wallet that corresponds to this user.

Import ZeroDev by adding this line to the top of `DApp.js`:

```
import * as zd from '@zerodevapp/sdk';
```

Find the `_connectGoogle` function in `DApp.js`, and add the following code:

```javascript
const _connectGoogle = (token) => {
  const wallet = await zd.getSigner({
    projectId: "insert your project ID",
    identity: "google",
    token: token,
  });
  this._initialize(wallet);
}
```

Note that you want to replace the `projectID` with your actual project ID from the dashboard.

`zd.getSigner` returns a [`Signer`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer) object that is compatible with popular Web3 libraries such as `Ethers.js`.  In other words, ZeroDev returns an object that is API-compatible with the `window.ethereum` object that MetaMask injects into the browser, so you can treat the ZeroDev wallet object the same way you treat a MetaMask wallet.  That's why we were able to write `this._initialize(wallet)` the same way we did for the MetaMask wallet.

At this point, confirm that you can sign into the DApp with Google and see your blockchain address.

## Use the DApp

At this point, we have removed the need for external wallets (e.g. MetaMask), which is the first major hurdle for using a DApp.  Now let's see if we can claim some tokens!  Click the claim button.

Oops!  Unfortunately we have no crypto to pay for gas.  We could send some MATIC to this address to get this to work, but didn't ZeroDev promise to remove the need for gas too?

Don't worry!  We will get to that right now.
