# Integrate DeFi

DeFi is arguably the most powerful use case of Web3, but currently it's plagued with usability issues:

- Entering and exiting positions typically involve a lot of transactions to approve/swap/deposit/withdraw many different kinds of tokens, requiring the users to repeatedly confirm transactions.

- When executing a complex DeFi plan, such as exiting a position and using the new liquidity to enter a new position, the user is exposed to the risk of "half-executed plans," where by the time the user executed the first few steps, the remaining steps have become un-executable, e.g. due to token price updates.

ZeroDev solves these issues elegantly through batching.  With one-click, your users would be able to execute multi-step DeFi plans, improving UX while reducing risk and gas cost.

One great way to integrate DeFi with ZeroDev is through [`Valha`](https://www.valha.xyz/), which generates DeFi calldata for interacting with various protocols.  Here's a [demo of using Valha with ZeroDev](https://zerodev.valha.xyz/), where you can enter and exit DeFi pools with one click.
